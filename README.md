# Jupiter Engine 
This repo is in its very beginning and at this time it represents a simple 2D/3D renderer that hasn't much to show. The renderer uses OpenGL as graphics API and at present most of the core OpenGL objects are abstracted away. Next to come is a simple scene editor. This project is inspired by TheCherno game engine series on YouTube.
### Build
